Questions and remaining tasks:

1. Compare models (NEFSC; NEAMAP & NEFSC; with spatio-temporal effects; without)
1. Develop seasonal model
1. PCA (or EOF - what's the difference?) model
1. Consider spatially-varying bottom temp
1. Gather model estimates and evaluation metrics
1. Get plankton data into model?
