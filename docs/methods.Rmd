*Disclaimer: These are results of my preliminary work that I use to synthesize and interpret with my mentors, probably riddled with problems. If you managed to stumble onto this, I'm sorry, because this is not going to be helpful to you.*

## Research Questions and Hypotheses
What is the spatio-temporal distribution of menhaden and how does it change over seasons and years? Are there more menhaden in the north in recent years than in the past? Are they moving more offshore?

Hypothesis 1: menhaden are expanding their range more northward as ocean temperature warms overall over years. 

Hypothesis 2: menhaden abundance is increasing but is not correlated with expanding distribution because their overall population is lower than what would drive density-dependent distribution.

Hypothesis 3: menhaden are migrating earlier in the spring and later in the fall as the timing of seasonal warming and cooling changes.

## Biological Data

* Menhaden catch from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) spring and fall bottom trawl surveys, 1963-2019
* Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (NEAMAP) near shore trawl, 2007-2020

## Environmental Covariate Data
Concurrent measurements from biomass surveys:

* Depth
* Bottom temperature

Future...

* chlorophyll-a
* currents
* wind

## Model Parameters

* Area swept: missing for NEFSC
* Catchability: missing
* Vessel effects: using different surveys as factor, but this is probably wrong

## Distribution Model

*The current model I have built...*

VAST: estimates the biomass density of menhaden at locations across a spatial area and over years as predicted by depth and bottom temperature in a spatio-temporally explicit model.

Broadly, the model is conceptually as follows, however, 

$Density = TemporalVar(\beta) + SpatialVar(\omega) + SpatioTemporalVar(\varepsilon) + VesselEffects(\eta) + Depth(\nu1) + BottomTemp(\nu2)$

```
fit = fit_model( "settings" = settings,
                 "Lat_i" = data.spring$Latitude,
                 "Lon_i" = data.spring$Longitude,
                 "t_i" = data.spring$Year, #time
                 "b_i" = data.spring$Biomass, #catch in biomass
                 "a_i" = data.spring$Areasw, #area swept
                 "v_i"= data.spring$Cruise, #representing vessel effects, but this is wrong
                 "X1_formula" = X1_formula, #depth
                 "X2_formula" = X2_formula, #bottemp
                 "covariate_data" = covariate_data, #depth and bottemp data
                 "input_grid" = user_region)
```

*What needs to be improved...*

* Resolve differences between surveys and account for catchability; Area swept is accurate for NEAMAP but not true for NEFSC and may be incorporated into how the Survdat data are transformed
* Spatially varying bottemp?
