Atlantic menhaden abundance was estimated across the sampled area within each season and for each year, 2007-2019, as predicted by depth and bottom temperature. Overall, menhaden distribution varies between seasons, between years, and between regions. Abundance is highest the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and North Carolina coast over all years and between seasons. In the north, from the New York Bight to the Maine coast, abundance is lower than to the south, but there are years of higher abundance (Figure \@ref(fig:dist)). Menhaden are most abundant along the coast, with localized abundance offshore around Georges Bank and the NY Bight.

Menhaden are more broadly distributed across the continental shelf in the spring than in the fall. In the fall, menhaden are more distributed toward the shore and to the north.

The center of gravity, which is the mean spatial location of the sampled population, weighted by biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:center)). This measure is most effective at assessing change over time if the distribution across the range is more homogenous and so it is unclear if this measurement is the most appropriate for this population. However, looking at the trend in recent years, there may be some movement more west and north, which could be interpreted as more coastal towards the north.

The second metric is the distributional range edge, which, for marine species along the US Atlantic coast, has been moving northward in relationship to warming ocean temperatures. VAST provides a calculation of the latitudinal and longitudinal range edge, or by northing and easting, respectively. Looking at the poleward shifts (latitudinal or northing edges), the northern (BLUE) and southern (RED) range edges of Atlantic menhaden, along with the centroid (GREEN), appear to be at latitude around the NYBight region in the spring (Figure \@ref(fig:springrange)) and fall (Figure \@ref(fig:fallrange)). This is more northern that the density maps would appear to suggest, given that the highest densities are at the Chesapeake and NC coast. There is a wider range edge in the spring (Figure \@ref(fig:springrange)) than the fall (Figure \@ref(fig:fallrange)), but I may not be interpreting the graph correctly, because the circles do not capture the southern edge. Overall, the range edge appears to be static or stable over years in both seasons.

Longitudinal range edge for Atlantic menhaden follows a similar static or stable trend (Figure \@ref(fig:erange)), with the same caveats as with the latitudinal range edge figure. Additionally, longitudinal range edge is limited by the shoreline and the shape of it, and has less biogeographical theory support than poleward changes, so longitudinal range edge may not be as informative.
