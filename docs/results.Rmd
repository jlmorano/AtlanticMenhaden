# VAST Model of Distribution
The model built in VAST is an index of abundance model that predicts the abundance as average catch over years and locations. This model uses data from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) spring and fall bottom trawl surveys, 1963-2019, and the Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (NEAMAP) near shore trawl, 2007-2020. For this model, the data are limited to overlapping years, 2007-2019.

The biomass of menhaden varies over the years
(Figure \@ref(fig:abundance))

The estimates of abundance and distribution are made over the extrapolation grid that encompasses the sampled area (Figure \@ref(fig:knots)). The knots (red dots) are used as computational points (Figure \@ref(fig:knots)).

For each sampled year of the NEFSC bottom trawl survey, 1963-2019, the Atlantic menhaden abundance is estimated across the sampled area. Note that these data are not verified as including all appropriate years and survey sites, and these data are pooling the spring and fall surveys into a single year. Thus, these results should be interpreted only as a preliminary understanding of the model output and should not be considered a representation of the actual ecology of menhaden. Given these caveats, in general, the distribution has changed periodically, with years of low abundance or absence in the north (Figure \@ref(fig:dist)). Menhaden are most abundant along the coast, with localized abundance offshore around Georges Bank and a localized absence in the NY Bight. More work is needed to examine this.

To quantify the change in the distribution of species, there are a few metrics that VAST calculates by default. The first is center of gravity, which is the mean spatial location of the sampled population, weighted by biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:center)). This measure is most effective at assessing change over time if the distribution across the range is more homogenous and so it is unclear if this measurement is the most appropriate for this population. However, looking at the trend in recent years, there may be some movement more west and north, which could be interpreted as more coastal towards the north.

The second metric is the distributional range edge, which, for marine species along the US Atlantic coast, has been moving northward in relationship to warming ocean temperatures. VAST provides a calculation of the latitudinal and longitudinal range edge, or by northing and easting, respectively, by default. In the default figure format, the northern (BLUE) and southern (RED) range edges of Atlantic menhaden, along with the centroid (GREEN), appear to be static or stable (Figure \@ref(fig:nrange)). However, when comparing the centroid in Figure \@ref(fig:center) to the centroid in Figure \@ref(fig:nrange), there may be detail of patterns of change that are lost in the scale of the range edge figure (Figure \@ref(fig:nrange)). Additionally, the range edges are near the survey extents, so the NEFSC survey may not fully capture the extent of menhaden distribution.

Longitudinal range edge for Atlantic menhaden follows a similar static or stable trend (Figure \@ref(fig:erange)), with the same caveats as with the latitudinal range edge figure. Additionally, longitudinal range edge is limited by the shoreline and the shape of it, and has less biogeographical theory support than poleward changes, so longitudinal range edge may not be as informative.
